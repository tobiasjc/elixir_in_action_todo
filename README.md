# TodoCache

A slightly updated version from the one given from the book "Elixir in Action, 2nd Ed." by Sas̄a Jurić.

Offers simpler operation names as "put/2" (list name, entry), "get/1" (date) and "all/0". The code is mostly compatible with the one given from the book.

Alterations made were all made by me with no supervision by any experts - therefore, the code provided doesn't aim to be better than the one from the book.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish) (which it is absolutely NOT), the package can be installed
by adding `todo_cache` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:todo_cache, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/todo_cache](https://hexdocs.pm/todo_cache).
